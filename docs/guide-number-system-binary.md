### Binary Number System
#

- It is the fundamental numbering system of a computer-based system.

- This number system follows the same set rule as the decimal number system,
  but unlike the decimal number system that uses the power of 10, the binary
  system works on the power of 2.

- The binary numeral system or base-2 number sytem represents numeric values
  using two symbols, 0 and 1.

- More specifically, the usual base-2 system is a positional notation with a
  radix of 2.

- Owing to its straightforward implementation in digital electronics circuitry
  using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by all modern computers.

- In the binary number system, a binary such as 1011011 is expressed with a string
  of 0's and 1's, with each digit along the string starting from right to left.

- As the decimal number is known as the weighted number, covering from decimal to
  binary or base 10 to base 2, this will also produce a binary number with the
  right-hand most bit being the least significant bit or LSB, and the left-hand bit
  being the most significant bit or MSB.
